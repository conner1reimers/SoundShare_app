            For soundshare, I wanted to create a simple webapp for music creators to share different sounds with each other. Not only can you discover sounds and then download them, I also
            decided to implement social media influenced functions, such as liking sounds, reposting sounds, following users, and more. I also have functions in the works for adding effects to sounds.
            The idea was pretty straightforward, though I had a lot to learn about database design and web design, which I {`didn't`} have much experience in, before coming to this conclusion. After 6 months of hard work I have
            a working prototype!
