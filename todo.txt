NEXT HYDRATION (user page)

It is mentioned in the doc that if you use getInitialProps in _app.js, you will lose the static optimization. I don't know why you are using redux on the server side, personally I will advise you to only 
use it on the client side and you won't need to use next-redux-wrapper anymore because it uses getInitialProps under the hood.
I have read the docs about the App.getInitialProps but I am not sure how to avoid it in this case. For some pages I am using getServerSideProps to fetch data for SSR. I am using redux-thunk for API calls 
and they route responses directly into redux. I would not like to skip redux as a single source of truth. Is that maybe a bad reasoning? – 
How would we go by restoring redux state from local storage when the app reloads? – 

If you have a layout as wrapper, you can do it in layout with useEffect – 
enoch
and i will suggest you to store your token in cookies not in localStorage

getStaticProps(): A method that tells the Next component to populate props and render into a static HTML page at build time.
