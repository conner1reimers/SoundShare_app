^^ Need to make a list of paths so site can generate HTML for each page - 

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [                                                    - The paths key determines which paths will be pre-rendered
      { params: { ... } } // See the "paths" section below
    ],
    fallback: true or false // See the "fallback" section below
  };
}

^^^ suppose that you have a page that uses dynamic routes named  pages/posts/[id].js
return {
  paths: [
    { params: { id: '1' } },
    { params: { id: '2' } }
  ],
  fallback: ...  <---- The object returned by getStaticPaths must contain a boolean fallback key.

  
}

If fallback is false, then any paths not returned by getStaticPaths will result in a 404 page. 
If fallback is true, then the behavior of getStaticProps changes: The paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to HTML at build time by getStaticProps. The paths that have not been generated at build time will not result in a 404 page. Instead, Next.js will serve a “fallback” version of the page on the first 
request to such a path 



https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering

If you export an async function called getServerSideProps from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page on each request using the data returned by getServerSideProps.

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {}, // will be passed to the page component as props
  }
}
